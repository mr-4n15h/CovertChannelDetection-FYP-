# CovertChannelDetection
Covert channel detection using Python and ML





My final year project looked into detecting covert storage channels in network packets using Python and Machine Learning. 

This project focuses on Cybersecurity, Software Engineering, Computer Networking, and other important topics in Computer Science. 

My supervisor, who is a Cybersecurity expert, gave me this idea during our first meeting; therefore, I wanted to solve it.
This idea was presented to me by my supervisor since this problem still exists to this day! The current Internet design weaknesses enables this attack methodology.
